# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Recommendation-System-on-Airbnb-data

Analyzed Airbnb rental data for Athens in 2019 and 2023 using Python and pandas. Consolidated CSV datasets, handled missing and extreme values, and performed exploratory data analysis through visualizations like histograms and heatmaps. Additionally, developed a recommendation system using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to suggest similar properties based on descriptions and amenities.

Used Hugging Face models (BERT, RoBERTa) for sentiment analysis on Airbnb reviews (2019 & 2023), preprocessing text data. Analyzed sentiment distribution over time and across neighborhoods. Built train/test datasets and trained classifiers (SVM, Random Forest, KNN) using TF-IDF and word embeddings. Evaluated model performance with 10-fold cross-validation. Implemented word similarity function based on cosine and Jaccard methods using word embeddings.
